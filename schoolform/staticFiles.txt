### USING STATIC FILES FOR DJANGO ###

-In django, you can't just load or use things like images, js etc. on the same manner 
we did to our templates inside templates dir.


## Steps

1. Making the Directory
 In able to do that, let's make "static/{app name}" dir on our app dir. Inside the "static" dir, you can also make other dirs such 
as "js" for javascript, "css" for CSS and "images" for images.
	-schoolform			# main dir
		registration	# app dir
			-js
			-css
			-images
		schoolform		# project dir

2. Configuring the Stic files
 After you make your css styles, save your background pictures or write your 
javascript files, we should configure it on our "settings.py" to access the files 
inside of it. To do it simply add the ff. on your settignd.py:

	STATICFILES_DIRS = [
		BASE_DIR / "static",
		'/var/www/static/',
	]

3. Importing the Static files
 To use the static files on your templates, add "{% load static %}" on the top most of 
the template/html file and add:
 	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static '/css/main.css' %}">

 Url in href was for formatted from "(BASE_DIR, 'static')" in STATICFILES_DIRS at 
settings.py to access the stattic files in static folder.
